Occasionally you may have to do some scripting to achieve some specific automation or integration goal. In a previous post, I mentioned the Control-M/Enterprise Manager API, which is the best choice when programming in Java and similar languages. In this post, I discuss a command line utility, called “cli”, which provides many of the same capabilities and is the best choice for shell scripts, batch files and other script-like environments like event management and other data center automation solutions.

There are a variety of other utilities many users are familiar with such as ctmorder and ctmcreate. However, these are platform specific and must be executed on either a specific agent or Control-M Server. If you desire or need solutions that are platform neutral, “cli” is the better choice.

Here are the functions you can perform with this utility:

Upload or download folders
Order or force folders
Order or force jobs
Force jobs in a folder
Upload or download calendars
Delete job processing definitions from folders

Windows

cli [{(-U emUser -P emPass) | -pf passwordFile}] -h hostName [-t timeout] [-DDMM] [-BY_FORCE] <cmd> [ACTION_REASON <reason for taking an audit action> [ACTION_NOTE <descriptive reason for audit action>]...

Unix/Linux

em cli [{(-U <emUser> -P <emPass>) | -pf <passwordFile>}] -h <hostName> [-t <timeout>] [-DDMM] [-BY_FORCE] <cmd> [ACTION_REASON <reason for taking an audit action> [ACTION_NOTE <descriptive reason for audit action>]...

Valid values for <cmd>:

-JOB_ORDER
-JOB_FORCE
-JOB_ORDER_INTO
-JOB_FORCE_INTO
-SUB_FOLDER_FORCE_INTO
-FOLDER_ORDER
-FOLDER_FORCE
-FOLDER_UPLOAD
-FOLDER_ DOWNLOAD
-CAL_UPLOAD
-CAL_DOWNLOAD
-SUB_FOLDER_DELETE
-JOB_DELETE
-MEM_DELETE
